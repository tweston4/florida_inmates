# Introduction

Do tattoos on inmates correlate to there prison terms or charges? This project utilizes a dataset of Florida inmates and their tattoos from 1980 - 2017, to analyze the correlation between tattoos and crime.

## Dataset

The dataset was shared to me from a colleague in a Data Analytics course and can be found [HERE](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/5mhudhvlx49sysw/AAAD0CBKKWs2WwbxyoHhKaM0a?dl=0).
